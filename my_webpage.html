<h4>Something from my hobbies</h4>

<h6>Entry 1: 19 Feb 2021</h6>
<p>One of my hobbies is reading books. This has been following me throughout my childhood, partly because I am introverse in nature. And one of my favourite books that I have read recently is <i>Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine</i>, by Gail Honeyman. The following quote clearly reflects a not-so-nice side of society:</p>

<blockquote cite='https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/47327681-eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine'>
<q>If someone asks you how you are, you are meant to say FINE. You are not meant to say that you cried yourself to sleep last night because you hadn't spoken to another person for two consecutive days. FINE is what you say.</q></blockquote>

<p>So..If any NLB member wants to read this book (or any other book that you like) on the go, without going to the library, you can click on the following link to use Libby.</p>
