My Initial Learning Stages of Coding

Hi there. Dheena here. Not new to coding, but out of touch a bit. Got that interest in coms all over again, after a fetish on nursing.
Got some tiny projects here, and my passion for ICT (especially software engg) grew strong only recently. I am preparing on my own to enter the field.
